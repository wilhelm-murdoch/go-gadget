Gadget is a simple CLI that allows you to inspect your Go source code using a relatively flat and simple representation. It's effectively a simpler layer of abstraction built on top of the Go AST package. Point this at your Go source code and you'll get a nice JSON object representing the values, functions, methods and types in your project.

It _inspects_ your _go_ code, hence the name:

### Why?
I was working on [another project](https://github.com/wilhelm-murdoch/go-collection) of mine and thought to myself, "It would be nice if I didn't have to constantly update this readme file every time I made a change." So, I started digging around Go's AST package and came up with Gadget.
### But, pkg.go.dev already does this ...
Yeah, I know. But, I didn't fully realise what I was writing until about 90% into the project. Maybe you don't want people to have to leave your repository to understand your API. Or, maybe you want to present this data in a different, more personalised, format.

It was fun to write and I use the tool almost daily.

Maybe you'll find it useful too. :)
## Download & Install

We publish binary releases for the most common operating systems and CPU architectures. These can be downloaded from the [releases page](https://github.com/wilhelm-murdoch/go-gadget/releases). Presentingly, Gadget has been tested on, and compiled for, the following:
1. Windows on `386`, `arm`, `amd64`
2. MacOS ( `debian` ) on `amd64`, `arm64`
3. Linux on `386`, `arm`, `amd64`, `arm64`

Download the appropriate archive and unpack the binary into your machine's local `$PATH`.

## Usage
Once added to your machine's local `$PATH` you can invoke Gadget like so:
```
$ gadget --help
NAME:
   gadget - inspect your code via a small layer of abstraction over Go's AST package

USAGE:
   gadget [global options] command [command options] [arguments...]

VERSION:
   v0.0.12

AUTHOR:
   Wilhelm Murdoch <wilhelm@devilmayco.de>

COMMANDS:
   help, h  Shows a list of commands or help for one command

GLOBAL OPTIONS:
   --source value, -s value    path to the target go source file, or directory containing go source files. (default: ".")
   --format value, -f value    the output format of the results as json, template or debug. (default: "json")
   --template value, -t value  if the template format is selected, this is the path to the template file to use. (default: "README.tpl")
   --help, -h                  show help (default: false)
   --version, -v               print only the version (default: false)

### JSON
Invoking the command with no flags will result in Gadget searching for `*.go` files by recursively walking through the present working directory. Results will be displayed as a JSON object following this structure:

- `packages`: a list of discovered packages.
  - `files`: any `*.go` file associated with the package.
    - `types`: discovered types, eg; structs, interfaces, etc...
      - `fields`: a list of fields associated with each type.
    - `functions`: functions and methods
    - `values`: explicitly-declared values, eg; constants and variables

A full example of the JSON object can be found in [here](./sink/sink.json).

### Debug
When invoking Gadget using the `--format debug` flag, you will get output representing all evaluated source code using `ast.Print(...)`. Use this to follow the structure of the AST.
```bash
$ gadget --source /path/to/my/project --format debug
... heaps of AST output ...
1298  .  .  15: *ast.FuncDecl {
1299  .  .  .  Doc: *ast.CommentGroup {
1300  .  .  .  .  List: []*ast.Comment (len = 1) {
1301  .  .  .  .  .  0: *ast.Comment {
1302  .  .  .  .  .  .  Slash: sink/sink.go:81:1
1303  .  .  .  .  .  .  Text: "// GetPrivate is an accessor method that returns a dark secret:"
1304  .  .  .  .  .  }
1305  .  .  .  .  }
1306  .  .  .  }
1307  .  .  .  Recv: *ast.FieldList {
1308  .  .  .  .  Opening: sink/sink.go:82:6
1309  .  .  .  .  List: []*ast.Field (len = 1) {
1310  .  .  .  .  .  0: *ast.Field {
1311  .  .  .  .  .  .  Names: []*ast.Ident (len = 1) {
1312  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  0: *ast.Ident {
1313  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  NamePos: sink/sink.go:82:7
1314  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Name: "nst"
1315  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Obj: *ast.Object {
1316  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Kind: var
1317  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Name: "nst"
1318  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Decl: *(obj @ 1310)
1319  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  }
1320  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  }
1321  .  .  .  .  .  .  }
... heaps more AST output
```
### Template
Use Go's template engine, along with [sprig](https://masterminds.github.io/sprig/), to generate technical documents or readme files ( like this one! ).
```bash
$ gadget --format template --template README.tpl > README.md
```
Or, without the `--template ...` flag as it will use `README.tpl` as the default template:
```
$ gadget --format template > README.md
```
The best way to understand this is by viewing the following "kitchen sink" examples:
1. [`sink/README.tpl`](./sink/README.tpl) is a valid Go template.
2. [`sink/README.md`](./sink/README.md) was generated using the specified Go template.

## Build Locally

Gadget makes use of Go's new generics support, so the minimum viable version of the language is `1.18.x`. Ensure your local development environment meets this single requirement before continuing. There are also several build flags used when compiling the binary. These populate the output of the `gadget --version` flag.
```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:wilhelm-murdoch/go-gadget.git
$ cd gadget
$ make build
$ ./gadget --version
Version: v99.99.99, Stage: local, Commit: 9932cf9fdc90c0d8223ef85a0fc1ddfa99c28f95, Date: 10-04-2022
```
### Testing
All major functionality of Gadget has been covered by testing. You can run the tests, benchmarks and lints using the following set of `Makefile` targets:
- `make test`: run the local testing suite.
- `make lint`: run `staticcheck` on the local source files.
- `make bench`: run a series of benchmarks and output the results as `cpu.out`, `mem.out` and `trace.out`
- `make pprof-cpu`: run a local webserver on port `:8800` displaying CPU usage stats.
- `make pprof-mem`: run a local webserver on port `:8900` displaying memory usage stats. 
- `make trace`: view local tracing output from the benchmark run.
- `make coverage`: view testing code coverage for the local source files.

## API

While gadget is meant to be used as a CLI, there's no reason you can't make use of it as a library to intgrate into your own tools. If you were wondering, yes, this readme file was generated by Gadget itself. Take a look at [README.tpl](./README.tpl), or the [README.tpl](./sink/README.tpl) in the "kitchen sink" example, to get an idea of how you would structure your own templates.
